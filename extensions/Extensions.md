# list of planned extensions

extensions are add-on apps that can process files, read/write to db, and provide their own user interfaces.

\* extensions can require other extensions as dependencies
e.g. a clip generator requires WhisperX and BERT

## machine learning

- whisperx transcriber
- mediapipe motion tracker -> tagging
- bert summarizer -> transcript -> generarate clip titles and descriptions
- coqui voice cloning

## user tools

- watch session history -> creates and saves table of every timestamp clicked too and watched (grouped by session) (enables back/forward button behavoir like in a browser)
